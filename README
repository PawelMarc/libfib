libfib is a library for fast and small fibers (cooperatively scheduled
userspace threads), which can load-balance an arbitrary number of
fibers onto an arbitrary number of hardware threads with
context-switch times on the order of a nanosecond (beat that,
Erlang!).

There's a few different synchronisation objects like mutexes,
condition variables, blocking channels, and an implementation of the
Actor model which has been tested up to tens of millions of actors.

To use any of this stuff, you'll need my modified version of the LLVM
compiler (see github.com/stedolan/llvm), and my patched version of the
Clang C/C++ compiler (you'll need to apply clang.patch from this repo
yourself).

This is a big ugly code-dump at the moment. I'll clean up the repo as
soon as the paper's written (promise!).
